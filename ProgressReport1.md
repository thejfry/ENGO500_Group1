# 2. Milestone Overview
## 2.1 Summary of Work Accomplished During this Period
> Template Instructions: Describe the work accomplished in this phase. Include a brief summary of the work accomplished in comparison to the work plan. Provide relevant samples of the work progress, that is useful for evaluating the progress, such as URLs of prototype, operational results, pictures of field work, sample data collected, URL of code repository, etc.

## 2.2 Lessons Learned
> Template Instruction: Insert in this section, an explanation of significant problems encountered and their solutions.


## 2.3 Changes to the Work Plan
> Template Instruction: If applicable to the project situation, describe here any changes to the work plan for the next milestone.

The following are items that have been components or dates that have changed from the work breakdown structure documented in the project proposal:

Change | Comments
---------------- | --------------------------
Control survey of testing environment milestone has been added | Trilateration Nation now plans on using a total station to observe key points in a testing laboratory and define a high precision local network of points. This survey will allow Trilateration Nation to do more in-depth precision analyses on the position estimation software. Thus, allowing users to have greater confidence that the position estimation software provided by Trilateration Nation is better than the current market standard.
Delivery date of basic app documentation has been changed | The delivery date for the completion of basic app has been made earlier to acheive a minimum viable producet of an app whose only function is to present data that has been post-processed on a geo-referenced map.
Delivery date of data stream documentation has been changed | The delivery date for the completion of data streaming functionality in the app has been made later so the minimum viable product of an app that displays location can be created first. Then, the real-time functionality can be added with the data stream.

## 2.4 List of Attachments
> Template Instruction: Insert the list of documents that are attached such as milestone components  that were listed in the milestone summary table.
