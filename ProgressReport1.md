# Milestone Overview
## Summary of Work Accomplished During this Period
> Template Instructions: Describe the work accomplished in this phase. Include a brief summary of the work accomplished in comparison to the work plan. Provide relevant samples of the work progress, that is useful for evaluating the progress, such as URLs of prototype, operational results, pictures of field work, sample data collected, URL of code repository, etc.

The work accomplished during this phase of the project coincides with the original WBS(???), as seen in the summary of milestones above. This phase of the project focused primarily on the developement of a Proof of Concept. For phase 1 Proof of Concept a post processed least squares estimation was preformed to determine the position of the user, using the ranges observed from each node.  The completed results from phase one can be found in the List of Attachements, below. The repository for the code used to implement this phase of the project can be found at ___URL___. 

The work accomplished in this phase was devided amongst group members. Tasks that were completed were as follows:

[1] Develop code to read the raw data file recorded by the Decawave Application. 
> This was completed in MATLAB. data was stored from each node location, at every epoch. The Postion solution provided from Decawave was also stored for a direct comparison with our estimation results. 
[2] Develop code for phase one Proof of Concept
> This was completed in MATLAB. 2D least squares estimation was preformed to determine the position of the user.
[3] Proof of Concept documentation
> Theory and results from phase one Proof of Concept were outlied and analysed. 
[4] Initial application developement
> Hello world applications were developed by group members in Android Studio, as well as the completion of basic tutorials on Android Studio app development.
