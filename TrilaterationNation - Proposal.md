# Project Overview
## Project Name
## Project Description
> Provide a short narrative description of the project.  Identify/describe any technical and business problem that would be solved, the key benefits and how the project aligns with/supports the strategic direction/objectives of the proponent organization or members, its collaborators, and clients/users.

Indoor positioning is an ongoing challenge in the market place. With cities growing up and architecture advancing, indoor navigation could be used for construction site navigation, 3D mapping of buildings and floorplans, and many other applications. Ultra-wideband real-time location systems, ranging radios, are a product on the marketplace, that can be used as a solution to this problem. The company Decawave currently makes a small, portable product, sold with their own application that allows the user to select the location of the node radios, and then, using the raw ranging data collected via Bluetooth streams, determines the position of the user [1]. This is done using a simple algorithm that calculates the position from each node, compares the positions, and selects the one that matches the other solutions the best [2]. To improve the user experience, an android application will be developed that will allow for the user to input node locations, upload blueprints, and view their position in real-time. The application will stream raw data from the array of ranging radios and calculate the users position using least squares estimation.

# Project Issues and Risks
## Issue Identification
> Specify any major policy, standards, data, technical, partnership and/or client engagement issues that need to be addressed in order for the project to be successful. 
 

## Feasibility and Risk 
> Identify and evaluate potential challenges or risks in completing and/or sustaining the project.  Please fill out the table and add any other applicable risks.  Examples of risks include: commitment risks, organization risks, contracting risks, technical risks, financial risks, human resources risks (such as the availability of qualified personnel or experienced personnel), project dependencies and/or policy issues related to data access (i.e. licensing, intellectual property, copyright, security, privacy etc). 

There are three main categories of risk within the project; software development, the use and reliability of the product and the open source software for processing and testing, and the risk of not completing the tasks or improving the client experience. The main risk for the completion of this project will be the limitations in software development. Streaming data in real time, programming with Java, and android application development are all new skills being developed by team members. The team currently has access to eight ranging devices, supplied by. However, the firmware embedded in the device currently only supports range values from four node locations. This limits the redundancy of the network, reducing the precision of the estimated position. Finally, the risk of not completing the project

No. | Risk Description | Severity (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation strategies for dealing with each risk 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
1 | Software Development | H | M | Cyclical development for achieving tasks. 
2 | Product Reliability | M | M | Addition ranging devices and potential firmware improvement updates.
3 | Project Completion | M | L | Set goals, and levels of completeness

> To demonstrate feasibility, make reference to past research, pilot projects, demonstrations, previous experience, and reports. Evaluate the mitigation statements against the Project Implementation Plan for availability of resources and flexibility to address potential risks.  If no mitigation is planned, indicate “none”.

To mitigate the level of risk within the project, tasks will be completed in a cyclical process. This will be done in 3 steps:
> 1. Proof of concept. This will be done by developing a basic program in MATLAB to read in raw data files recorded on Decawave's application. The program will use least squares estimation to determine a position at each epoch, using all four ranges. These positions will then be plotted and compared with the solution obtained by the Decawave application. 
> 2. Team members will learn to use Java and stream raw data directly from the ranging devices, into estimation software, where the least squares estimation developed in Step 1 will be used to estimate the position.
> 3. An android application will be developed to run estimation software and display the results of the program to the screen for the user. 
The application can be improved upon by adding user features such as the ability to upload floor plans, select node locations on the screen and, and augmenting the least squares estimation to a sequential least squares, or Kalman filter.
