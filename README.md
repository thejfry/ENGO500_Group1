## Indoor Positioning using Ranging Radios

> The purpose of this project will be to develop an Android application to enable the rapid deployment of an ultra-wideband real-time location system. Users will deploy between 4 and 8 ranging-radio nodes in a service area, the application will then allow the user to determine their locations by pointing and clicking the node locations on a building floor plan. Code will be developed and executed to compute the position of a mobile node through trilateration. This will be completed by:

> 1.	Data collection and proof of concept to determine positions through post processing,
> 2.	Real time data collection and processing, 
> 3.	Android application development and testing to display positions in a user friendly interface.

> Testing will be completed at each step, including but not limited to various testing environments and data analysis approaches. The possibility of the use of low cost INS and other self-contained sensors to improve the indoor position will also be explored.  
  
  

This is the project that will be completed by Group 1 of the ENGO 500 course in the Fall 2018 and Winter 2019 semesters, which is made up of Paul Gratton, Jamie Horrelt, Kate Pexman, and Jeffrey Plett.
